# Penalty Shootout (Year 2 University 2018/19)  
A basic Penalty Shootout using Object-Oriented C++, with the SFML lib & Box 2D.  
I was tasked to design, build and test a 2D sports simulation which is viewed from the top
down. The simulation must make some use of real-time physics.  
  
Specification of game mechanics:  
• Static graphical background  
o A picture which forms the background of the game  
• Moving game objects  
o Some kind of game object (actor) which:  
 Undergoes realistic motion  
 Collides with other game objects  
• Implementation of defined rules for winning and/or losing  
• A head-up-display (HUD)  
o HUD can be simple text or a more advanced graphical element  
o Could show any aspect of game information  
  
The sports aspect of the game can be widely interpreted, snooker, pool, air hockey
for example are all acceptable.
